## Comment

A comment is a line denoted by a `#` character and includes all characters until a newline or end of the document.

Throughout the specification's life, comments have traditionally been written on a line by themselves and never inline.

However starting in version 4.0, comments can be inline with words and quoted strings, however, they are not allowed in tags.

### Example

```
# Comment
# This is a comment
A # This is also a valid comment
```
