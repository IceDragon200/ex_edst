## Dialogue

A dialogue is denoted by a `@` character followed by a space and then any number of words and terminated by a quoted string or heredoc.

Dialogues are used to denote some kind of speech by a character.

### Example

```
  @ Character "Speech"

  @ John Doe "This is my speech, here me now!"

  # As of 5.0, heredocs can also be used

  @ John Doe """
  Now I can speak with multiple lines!

  Isn't that awesome!
  """
```
