## Label

Labels are denoted by a line starting with `--` and then one or more spaces and finally terminated by a `--`.

Labels are used to mark sections of the document of interest or for breaking up longer sections into digestable segments.

Empty labels are allowed and are normally treated as dividers in a document.

### Example

```
# This is a label with a value, and is treated typically as the start of a part
-- Section I --

# The following is treated as a divider, or an end of a "part"
-- --
```
